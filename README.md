# Smart Traffic Signal System 


## Overview
```
This project implements a full-fledged AI-based Smart Traffic Signal System that intelligently manages signal timings at a four-way junction using real-time traffic data.
The system leverages cutting-edge deep learning techniques and reinforcement learning to ensure efficient traffic flow and reduced congestion. It is designed to be adaptable, scalable, and suitable for deployment in urban smart city environments.
```

## Objectives

```
Dynamically allocate green signal duration based on real-time vehicle density.

Ensure optimal traffic movement using reinforcement learning.

Simulate real-world traffic conditions using SUMO.

Automate signal switching without manual intervention.
```


## System Architecture

### Dual Camera Setup per Lane:
```
Main Camera (at signal): Detects and counts vehicles waiting at the red signal.

Second Camera (100 meters away): Detects incoming vehicles just before green ends and sends data to the main camera for future optimization.
```


## Core Components
```
Module	Description
YOLOv8	Real-time object detection to identify vehicles from camera feeds
DeepSORT	Multi-object tracking to assign IDs and count unique vehicles
Actor-Critic RL Agent	Allocates optimal green signal timing based on traffic flow
SUMO	Traffic simulation environment for reinforcement learning integration
OpenCV + PyTorch	Video processing and model deployment backend
```
